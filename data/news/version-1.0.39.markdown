Updated Plugins
---------------

Those plugins needs to be updated:

- [Sendgrid](https://kanboard.net/plugin/sendgrid)
- [Mailgun](https://kanboard.net/plugin/mailgun)
- [Postmark](https://kanboard.net/plugin/postmark)

Instead of using the project identifier, you should use the project email address now.

Email attachments are now supported.
In case the original email is not converted correctly in Markdown, the original copy is saved into the task.
